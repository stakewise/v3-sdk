For successful utilization of this library, ensure you have `ethers` version 6.13.2 or higher installed. The `ethers` package isn't bundled within the SDK. Instead, we leverage `peerDependencies` to maintain a lean package size.

:::tip Note

If your project uses version 5 of `ethers`, consider installing version 6 alongside it. Adjust import paths via a bundler. Additionally, you might consider loading our SDK asynchronously using dynamic imports to optimize your application's initial load performance. Here's a sample configuration with webpack:

:::

```bash
npm i ethers-6@npm:ethers@6.13.2
```
#### You can do something similar for other builders as well:

```js
webpackConfig.plugins.push(
  new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(
    /ethers$/m, (resource) => {
      const isStakeWise = /@stakewise\/v3-sdk/.test(resource.context)

      if (isStakeWise) {
        resource.request = resource.request.replace(/ethers/, 'ethers-6')
      }
    }
  )
)
```
