The official SDK for seamlessly pulling data from the StakeWise platform. It is a wrapper over graphql queries and contract queries. Also included in the package are our basic contracts, which will be connected to your provider if needed

## Requirements
Installed ethers 6.6.7+ is required This package is not included in the library (peerDependencies are used), but must be installed in your application. In the future we will try to update the ethers library with the latest version in a timely manner. If you are using ethers 5 or less, there are 2 solutions:
1. Upgrade to ethers 6, it is much more convenient.
2. You can install ethers 6 version separately, but it will expand your bandle:

`npm i ethers-6@npm:ethers@6.6.7`

Now you have ethers of your version and ethers-6. Now we can swap the use of imports within our library. If you are using webpack, you can implement it this way:

```typescript
webpackConfig.plugins.push(
  new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(
    /ethers$/m, (resource) => {
      const isStakeWise = /@stakewise\/v3-sdk/.test(resource.context)

      if (isStakeWise) {
        resource.request = resource.request.replace(/ethers/, 'ethers-6')
      }
    }
  )
)
```
You can do something similar for other builders as well

## Usage

Install SDK
```bash
npm i @stakewise/v3-sdk
```

Create SDK instance

```typescript
import { StakeWiseSDK, Network } from '@stakewise/v3-sdk'

const sdk = new StakeWiseSDK({ network: Network.Mainnet })

```
#### SDK Constructor Arguments:

| Name | Type | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| network | `Network` | **Require** | Chain id |
| provider | `any` | **Optional** | You can provide your implementation of the provender for ethers |
| endpoints.subgraph | `string` | **Optional** | stakewise sbugraph url |
| endpoints.web3 | `number` | **Require** | Your url for connect to blockchian |
| endpoints.api | `string` | **Optional** | stakewise backend url |

## API

### `sdk.requests.getAllocatorActions()`

#### Description:

Get a list of interactions with the vault.

#### Arguments:

| Name | Type | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| vaultAddress | `string` | **Require** | - |
| userAddress | `string` | **Optional** | If a user address is specified, the query will look for events for that address and the vault address only |
| types | `AllocatorActionType` | **Require** | Event types can be found in `enum AllocatorActionType` which you can import from the library |
| limit | `number` | **Require** | To implement pagination |
| skip | `number` | **Require** | To implement pagination |

#### Returns:

```ts
type Output = Array<{
  actionType: AllocatorActionType
  createdAt: number
  assets: string
  link: string
  id: string
}>
```

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `id` | Event identifier |
| `assets` | Transaction amount |
| `createdAt` | Transaction date |
| `actionType` | Type of action |
| `link` | Transaction link (etherscan/blockscout) |

#### Example:

```ts
import { AllocatorActionType } from '@stakewise/v3-sdk'

sdk.requests.getAllocatorActions({
  skip: 0,
  limit: 20,
  userAddress: '0x...',
  vaultAddress: '0x...',
  types: [
    AllocatorActionType.Redeemed,
    AllocatorActionType.Deposited,
    AllocatorActionType.VaultCreated,
    AllocatorActionType.ExitedAssetsClaimed,
  ],
})
```

### `sdk.requests.getDaySnapshots()`

#### Description:

TVL and APY snapshots for the vault. With the help of this data it is possible to build a chart.

#### Arguments:

| Name | Type | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| unixStartOfDay | `number` | **Require** | Time to start |
| vaultAddress | `string` | **Require** | - |

#### Returns:

```ts
type DaySnapshot = {
  APY: number
  TVL: string
}

type Output = {
  days: Record<number, DaySnapshot>
  first: DaySnapshot
}
```

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `days` | The result of the query on your parameters, is returned as an object where the keys are timestamps |
| `first` | We always send the very first saved snapshot regardless of the request parameters, this helps for rendering the chart |

#### Example:

```ts
sdk.requests.getDaySnapshots({
  vaultAddress: '0x...',
  unixStartOfDay: 1695730032793,
})
```
